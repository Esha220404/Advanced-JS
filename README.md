Advanced Styling and Javascript

A.Apply responsive design using media queries.

During my internship, I gained hands-on experience in front-end web development by working on several small but useful projects. One of my main tasks was to make sure the website looked good and worked well on different screen sizes like mobile phones, tablets, and desktops. I used CSS media queries to adjust the layout, font sizes, and spacing, which helped improve the user experience on all devices. 

B.Build an interactive Quiz.
I also worked on creating an interactive quiz using JavaScript. The quiz had multiple questions, and I added features like showing the correct answer and keeping score, which made it fun and engaging for users.

C.Fetch data from an API using JAvascript.
Additionally, I learned how to fetch real-time data using APIs. I connected to a public weather API and displayed live weather updates on the website. This taught me how to work with external data and update the webpage content without refreshing it. Overall, these projects helped me understand how to build responsive, interactive, and dynamic websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
